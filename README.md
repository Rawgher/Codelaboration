# CODELABORATION

## HOW TO USE THIS APP

This is a JAM Stack application geared towards programmers looking to collaborate on projects. The aim of this application is to provide a place for programmers to quickly find projects to work on or people to collaborate with.

There are two entry points the application; **Create Collab** and **Active Collabs**.

### Create Collab:

The Create Collab button takes you to a form page which allows you to post an advert for the project you will be seeking collaborators for. The form takes inputs that include things such as the title of the project, description, number of collaborators needed, preferred technology, and potential timelines.

Once submitted, a collaboration profile is created and posted to the _Active Collabs_ page.

### Active Collabs:

As mentioned above, the Active Collabs page displays all active adverts. The advert details can be viewed by clicking each respective card. A user can then search for projects they want to collaborate on. They can click the "Colab" button and fill out their application and start a communication with the original poster.
